    <p>PayPal has been supporting Kiva by providing free transactions on their network for the past ten years. They decided to celebrate the anniversary of their partnership with <a href="https://partnerships.kiva.org/how-paypal-showed-customers-the-big-impact-of-small-loans/">10 Days of Lending</a>, encouraging PayPal employees to make charitable loans on Kiva.</p>

    <p>During the project I worked closely with our designer, Josh to create a responsive microsite with CSS animations, to give PayPal employees all of the details about the partnership, and to help them get started on Kiva.</p>

    <p>I also worked closely with Rachel from Kiva to jump through some JavaScript and CSS hoops while getting the production code into Kiva’s content management system.</p>

    <p>The result was featured on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006084107/https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal home page</a>.</p>

    <!--
    <p>Additionally, my role involved creating prototypes, facilitating design discussions, getting sign-off from decision-makers, writing production-quality HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the user interface, testing for accessibility and browser/device compatibility, and fine-tuning the code for better performance.</p>
